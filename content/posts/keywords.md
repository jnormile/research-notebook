For transparency's sake, as I continue to plumb the depths of the already discovered (in terms of academic scholarship) I've opted to share the **keywords** that are guiding my exploration. The below list is constantly in a state of flux, but the research I'm locating has been found by using some combination of the following words and phrases:

* Pedagogy
* Curriculum
* Education
* Learning
* Comprehension
* Retention
* Computer science
* Gamification
* Programming language
* Rust
