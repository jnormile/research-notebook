In my last post I was left mulling over a lingering question from [a 2008 study on dynamic media and its impact on learning](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/jeductechsoci.11.1.279.pdf). The study found, you may recall, that complicated subject matter benefitted *more* from having learning media that was **"dynamic"** in nature. The definition of "dynamic" media was restricted to animated visuals for that study, and I found myself wondering: how much more might complicated learning matter benefit from learning material that was even more *dynamic* than that?

I'm a lifelong gamer. I don't remember a time where I didn't own at least *one* dedicated video game console. Some of my earliest childhood memories are of fumbling with an NES controller, or struggling to sound out the words in a [*Final Fantasy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_(video_game)) text box, which my dad cleverly used as a vehicle to jumpstart my interest in reading.

> To me, there's nothing more *dynamic* than a **video game**.

Hence, our next research article in our continuing exploration of programming pedagogy: ["Gamification of Education: A Literature Review"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-07293-7_39). This 2014 text surveyed fifteen different studies on the impact of **gamification**--the addition of elements typically found in video games, like leaderboards, achievements, progress bars, etc.--on education.

Not surprisingly (at least to me), one of the most meaningful impacts of gamification was an increase in learner **engagement**, a finding that's explicitly cited by eleven of the fifteen articles surveyed. Some other notable outcomes include an increase in learner *motivation*, *enjoyment*, and senses of *accomplishment* and *achievement*.

I previously described my initial experience with learning to code as being *addictive*, a trait that's commonly assigned to video games as well (something that my partner will heartily agree with, given the hours I've spent chasing after the [endorphin-releasing sound of a PlayStation platinum trophy popping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILhMsCd6hUY)). It's no surprise that the qualities of gaming that make players come back for more help make the education process one that sucks learners in (at least more than, say, a textbook and a chalkboard might).

Already I'm beginning to see the dots connect between *pedagogy*, *coding*, and well, *gaming*. Let's see how this picture continues to unfold.
