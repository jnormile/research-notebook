My name is Jeff Normile and I'm a student at Allegheny College pursuing an education in both Computer Science and Communications.

As can be inferred from the sidebar, I have a particular interest in **the way we learn**. I think it behooves *any* student to think critically about the ways in which they process and synthesize new information into usable, actionable knowledge, though this feels especially important for myself: after a decade in the workforce I decided to pivot and make the return to academia, so coming from a decade of my time being money has led me to constantly evaluate the **value** of my time in the classroom.

The questions that come from this line of thinking now inspire my research interests.
