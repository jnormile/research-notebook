If there's one thing clear from my last post, it's that I firmly believe that the learning process can be a *deeply* engaging process...if it's approached the right way.

The type of learning I discussed last time was a **tangible**, **hands-on** approach. Learning by **doing**, so to speak: writing code, tackling stack traces, and seeking out the guidance of those who programmed before. This type of work was [dynamic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dynamic); constantly changing, and made up of *energy* and *force*, per our friends at Merriam-Webster.

**Dynamic** also happens to be the word of choice for the first article reviewed in this exploratory research endeavor. The 2008 text [Dynamic Media in Computer Science Education; Content Complexity and Learning Performance: Is Less More?](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/jeductechsoci.11.1.279.pdf) explores the relationship between **learning** and two types of media: **static** (think traditional approaches like textbooks) and **dynamic** (for the purpose of this study, explicitly defined as animated visual material).

The study compared the two approaches in the context of teaching an undergraduate computer science class complex computer science principles. To nearly nobody's surprise, the dynamic media was decidedly more effective in helping students *retain* and *understand* the material presented.

There is a somewhat surprising kernel of information to be found in the text though: 

> The results showed that learning performance using dynamic media was significantly higher than 
those of the static textbook lesson when the learning material had a certain level of complexity; the more 
complex the learning material, the larger the benefit of using animations (Holzinger, et al).

The benefits of dynamic media *increase* as the **complexity** of the material being learned increases.

One question still lingers, however: is this benefit restricted to this article's specific definition of dynamism in terms of learning media (animated visuals)? Or does this benefit extend to an expanded definition of dynamic media? Does this benefit perhaps, as I hypothesize, *increase* as the definition of dynamic media expands to include ever more hands-on approaches to learning?

Let's find out together.
