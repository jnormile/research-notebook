Having just formally submitted a project proposal for the endeavor entertained by this research notebook, I've taken the liberty of distilling the highlights from said proposal for a more informal look at `playbook`--the working name for the project I plan on tackling next year, and have already spent considerably time laying groundwork for.

To begin with, I'll first revisit the question of **why?**

As is often the case with anything that someone compellingly pursues and devotes much of their time to, the motivation for this project is a particularly personal one. I haven't mentioned it here yet, but my academic career has been unconventional: I enrolled in undergraduate studies in my late twenties. After spending about a decade being disenchanted with a middle management position with a nation-spanning retailer, I opted to make a dramatic pivot and go back to school, hoping to open a few doors towards a work experience that I could personally deem more fulfilling and meaningful. Through a series of fortuituous happenstances, that pivot was much less cost-intensive than it generally proves to be, and I found myself able to seize a unique opportunity not generally presented to working American adults.

The personal backstory aside, the premise behind my project is equal parts simple and ambitious. I want to create a way for others to experience even a fraction of the personal growth that I have through my current educational journey pursuing a degree in computer science. I want to open a door of opportunity to other disenchanted adults looking for a new path, and I want to do it at no cost to them other than their time.

It's worth noting that the structure of this endeavor is motivated by research as well. Though I've spent my time (and yours) within numerous posts elaborating on research related to the gamification of pedagogy, there's couple key pieces of research that much of my proposed idea hinges on. First and foremost, there's 

This, of course, brings us to the **what** of it all.

The proposed `playbook` project will aim to offer users a browser-based platform for learning the fundamentals of the Rust programming language. I plan for it to leverage three components in order to do so: 

- Educational text pertaining to specific programming fundamentals in the Rust programming language (with a planned writing style of "recipe blog meets classroom teacher", weaving in anecdotes and a more informal tone to keep the platform presenting as friendly and engaging) 

- Corresponding hands-on coding activities related to the aforementioned text that will invite users to put principles laid out in writing into practice of their own

-  Progress bars, badges, and similar gamification elements designed to prompt the user towards further exploration of the text and the activities and reward user progress
