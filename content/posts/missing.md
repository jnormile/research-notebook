The research I've reviewed here thus far has been a little on the dated side, with one text from 2009 and another from 2014. To remedy this, I've recently looked at ["The Effectiveness of Gamification in Programming Education: Evidence from a Meta-Analysis"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X22000510), a 2022 literature review on gamification approaches as they specifically apply to teaching programming. The review examines 21 texts and synthesizes some of the emergent themes regarding the intersection of gamification, education, and computer science.

Interestingly, though the meta-analysis looks at a **wide** spread of varying types of gamification--including even the implementation of robotic agents to assist in gamifying the classroom--one type of gamified learning environment that isn't explicitly considered anywhere in the analysis is a "teacher-less" context. I.e., a scenario where the game outright *replaces* the teacher (such as in an e-learning situation)--a context I happen to be especially interested in.

This particular gamification approach *was* examined in a 2018 text, ["Effect of Gamification on E-Learning to Support Learning Achievement and Learning Motivation"](http://www.jatit.org/volumes/Vol96No12/4Vol96No12.pdf), though their own analysis was strictly limited to junior high students.

Literature on teacher-less implementations of gamified education processes are scarce, but that scarcity continues to exponentially increase as we further define the expected context. What if the learners aren't junior high students, but adult learners? What if we're interested in learning a specific skill, like a *particular* programming language? As would be expected, this increase in specificity results in a profound scarcity of established literature.
