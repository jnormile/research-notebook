How do we effectively **teach** entirely new ways of thinking--like teaching someone who's never seen a terminal window to write their first few lines of code? What practices and behaviors are useful for meaningfully maximizing our time spent grappling with and **learning** a complex concept--like a heady algorithm that seems all but impenetrable at first glance?

Questions like these drive my research into pedagogy as it pertains to the science and art of programming, a craft that's quickly become very personal for me. Not two years ago I found myself writing my first lines of code in Python and soon thereafter experienced the [coder's high](https://slate.com/technology/2014/06/coders-high-the-intense-feeling-of-absorption-exclusive-to-programmers.html) for the first time. Given my own novice status as a person who writes code, I'm *constantly* being exposed to new perspectives and insights on the practice. The barrage of lectures, videos, tutorials, and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) posts that I find myself subjected to is both overwhelming and intoxicating. *You can do __that__?* I find myself saying, time and again, every time a new trick or elegantly simple algorithm rears its head. 

After years of being hopelessly bored in the classroom, I've discovered that the learning process can be a deeply emotional, wholly fulfilling, and crave-inducing experience.

> This has led me to the most important question of the bunch: **why?**

Why isn't *all* learning like this? What has made this particular learning journey so **engaging** for me, so **interesting**, **absorbing**, and borderline **addicting** that I *can't* look away?

I'm hoping that research into the *pedagogy* of programming will help unearth some of the science that has made this particular experience a seemingly *magical* one for myself. By breaking down the scholarly research that aims to understand the distinct components that make learning possible, efficient, and *meaningful*, I myself aim to cultivate a better sense of **how to learn**.
