# About Me

My name is Jeff Normile and I'm a student at Allegheny College pursuing an education in both Computer Science and Communications.

As can be inferred from the sidebar, I have a particular interest in **the way we learn**. I think it behooves *any* student to think critically about the ways in which they process and synthesize new information into usable, actionable knowledge, though this feels especially important for myself: after a decade in the workforce I decided to pivot and make the return to academia.

Coming from a decade of my time being money, I find myself constantly evaluating the **value** of my time in the classroom--both from a student *and* an instructor perspective. The questions that come from this line of thinking now inspire my research interests. How do we effectively **teach** entirely new ways of thinking--like teaching someone who's never seen a terminal window to write their first few lines of code? What practices and behaviors are useful for meaningfully maximizing our time spent grappling with and **learning** a complex concept--like a heady algorithm that seems all but impenetrable at first glance?
