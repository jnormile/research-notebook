The type of learning I discussed last time was a tangible, hands-on approach. Learning by doing, so to speak: writing code, tackling stack traces, and seeking out the guidance of those who programmed before. This type of work was dynamic; constantly changing, and made up of energy and force, per our friends at Merriam-Webster.</description></item><item><title>Questions</title><link>https://jnormile.github.io/research-notebook/posts/questions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 12:07:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jnormile.github.io/research-notebook/posts/questions/</guid><description>How do we effectively teach entirely new ways of thinking&amp;ndash;like teaching someone who&amp;rsquo;s never seen a terminal window to write their first few lines of code? What practices and behaviors are useful for meaningfully maximizing our time spent grappling with and learning a complex concept&amp;ndash;like a heady algorithm that seems all but impenetrable at first glance?
Questions like these drive my research into pedagogy as it pertains to the science and art of programming, a craft that&amp;rsquo;s quickly become very personal for me.</description></item><item><title>Hello</title><link>https://jnormile.github.io/research-notebook/posts/hello/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 12:07:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jnormile.github.io/research-notebook/posts/hello/</guid><description>My name is Jeff Normile and I&amp;rsquo;m a student at Allegheny College pursuing an education in both Computer Science and Communications.
As can be inferred from the sidebar, I have a particular interest in the way we learn. I think it behooves any student to think critically about the ways in which they process and synthesize new information into usable, actionable knowledge, though this feels especially important for myself: after a decade in the workforce I decided to pivot and make the return to academia, so coming from a decade of my time being money has led me to constantly evaluate the value of my time in the classroom.</description></item></channel></rss>
